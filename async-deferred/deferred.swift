/**
  An asynchronous computation.

  A `Deferred` starts out undetermined, in the `.Waiting` state.
  It may then enter the `.Executing` state, and will eventually become `.Determined`.
  Once it is `.Determined`, it is ready to supply a result.

  The `value` property will return the result, blocking until it becomes determined.
  If the result is ready when `value` is called, it will return immediately.

  A closure supplied to the `notify` method will be called after the `Deferred` has become determined.
