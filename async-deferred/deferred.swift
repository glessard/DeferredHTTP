  An asynchronous computation.

  A `Deferred` starts out undetermined, in the `.Waiting` state.

  The `result` property will return the result, blocking until it becomes determined.
  If the result is ready when `result` is called, it will return immediately.

  A closure supplied to the `notify` method will be called after the `Deferred` has become determined.
